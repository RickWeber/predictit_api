# Predictit API

[https://www.predictit.org/](PredictIt.org) has an API giving up to date details
on contracts every minute. This project is meant to make it easier to gather
those updates and roll them together into historical data. `hourly_data.R` is
set up to gather one hour worth of data and save a csv file using R.
